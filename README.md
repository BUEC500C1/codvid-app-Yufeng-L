# Covid app     
   
#### Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment [Done]        
1. since node_modules files are big, only App.js file uploaded to the repo. 
2. Follow env set up on react-native :https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
3. For this hw, I used Expo CLI quickstart.   
```
npm install -g expo-cli
expo init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
npm install
npm start
```

#### Step 2: Build and run Hello App on emulator and phone [Done]      
Simply Copy App.js file and replace the older js file in your initialized project.

#### Step 4:  On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text.  Be fancy!  Style your results. [Done]      
I did this after step1 and 2 in order to show the status of the covid cases with out map implemented.<br>

#### Step 5:  Overlay the data on the maps. [Done]        
There are multiple countries set and you can move the map to click on the marker.<br>
And the marker would show you the current status of covid cases.
